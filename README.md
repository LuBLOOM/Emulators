# Emulators

# Emulator Concept
The concept of this project is to compile and assemble all of the files and link them against main,
this will create all the different emulators which are created within the repository.

## Current Emulators
### Chip-8
Compile and assemble main.c and the chip.c file located in the CHIP8 folder. then link these two together.
This will create the CHIP8 emulator.
